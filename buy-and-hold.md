# Estrategia buy-and-hold

1. A Rule-Based Dynamic Decision-Making Stock Trading System Based on Quantum-Inspired Tabu Search Algorithm.
  + _The method of Buy and Hold buy the stock in the beginning day and sell stock in the end of testing period._

2. Evolving trading strategies using directional changes.
  + _A very common investment strategy, albeit a passive one, is buy and hold , and commonly acts as benchmark for trading algorithms. The principle of this strategy is based on the view that in the long run financial markets give a good rate of return to investors. Thus, in this strategy an investor buys an asset and holds it for a long time, without being concerned about short-term price movements. Then at the end of a given period, s/he sells the stock and potentially makes profit based on the price difference._

3. Generating trading rules on the stock markets with genetic programming.
  + _Basically, if a company and its activity sector look promising, the trader buys and keeps his assets over a relatively long time period. An alternative approach, known as market timing, is more dynamic and focuses on short-term fluctuations._

  + _For an investment period extending from day 0 to day t, the return of the buy-and-hold approach is simply the price of day t minus the price of day 0._

4. Outperforming buy-and-hold with evolved technical trading rules.
  + _the return of buying at the first day and selling at the last day of the period, involving a single buy and a single sell transaction._

5. Using genetic algorithms to find technical trading rules.
  + _The return for the buy-and-hold strategy (buy the first day, sell the last day)._

6. Biclustering learning of trading rules.
  + _The BAH implies to buy at the start of the period and sell at its end._
